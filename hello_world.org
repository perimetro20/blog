* Introduction
  My screename is ~perimetro20~, my actual name is Andreé Toledo, I am a software developer from México. 

* Content Goals
  This is my blog in which I'll post about the different technical aspects in which I have something to contribute.
  I intend to post content continuously, which might include opinion pieces, product anouncements, technical descriptions and tutorials.
  I hope for my readers to find technical and interesting value in what I publish and for this blog to furhter their technical careers as many
  others have done the same for me.

* Technical Goals
  This blog is a code project in-and-on-itself. It is starting as a barebones export of an org file to html, and as it progresses
  I'll add new and more exciting features. Updates to the blog will be posted as technical posts with all the code included.
  
  #+CAPTION: This is a screenshot of the current state of the blog, hopefully it will work as a nice time machine to look back on the progress made.
